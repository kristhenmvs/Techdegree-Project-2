# Techdegree-Project-2
 My second techdegree project.

 In this project, I added pagination links at the buttom of the page in order to display only ten students (or less, in the case of the last page) per page.

 In this opportunity, I'm attempting to earn a 'Meets expectations', but I intent to come back later on to add the functionalities of a 'Exceeds expectations' project.
